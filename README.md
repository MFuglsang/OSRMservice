<h>OSRM as a windows service</h>

<p>The goal of this project is to combine OSRM backend with WinSW to creata a configurable installer, exposing OSRM as a windows service.</p>
<p>The service should be easy to maintain, through simple configuration and pre-defined cmd files, manageing the service. Using the native configuration of OSRM through .lua files for the profiling, and the simplicity of WinSW for the management of the service - it should be quite simple to set up a Windows service of OSMR-backend. </p>
